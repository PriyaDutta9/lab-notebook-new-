Objective:
Meet with Spurlock Museum over Zoom for project onboarding. Review legacy documentation from previous ECE 445 teams. Investigate failures in earlier PCB designs. 
Begin evaluating suitable microcontroller options for redesigned LED control board. 

Narrative / Work Log:
We had our first project meeting with the Spurlock Museum staff this week via Zoom. They introduced us to the history of the dome, its original design goals, and 
shared their expectations: synchronized lighting and camera triggering, reliable and maintainable control hardware, and documentation suitable for long-term 
museum operation. I took meeting notes and consolidated the staff's list of technical priorities into a google doc. Then, we reviewed the design reports and PCB 
schematics submitted by the Fall 2024 and Spring 2022 dome teams on Box. Key issues that we identified included poor LED sequencing reliability, inconsistent 
shutter activation, and signal crosstalkâ€”particularly on the I/O lines adjacent to high-current LED drivers. My team member highlighted suspect areas in the silkscreen 
and shared screenshots with us. I also began evaluating microcontrollers that could be better than the ones used previously. I considered STM32 Blue Pill (low cost, flexible),
Teensy 4.1 (performance), and ATmega328P (standard Arduino-compatible). After comparing the microcontrollers, we concluded that ATmega32U4 would be ideal for our application. 
It has built-in USB functionality, robust Arduino library support, and is used in many commercial controller boards. Its known compatibility with the prior team's GUI also 
made it the best option.
