Objective:
Define a feasible initial project idea for ECE 445. Begin technical research and documentation of possible implementation paths. 

Work Log:
After initial brainstorming, we decided to work on implementing Prof Bernhard's idea of making a semi-automated window-cleaning robot designed to traverse tall window surfaces. 
We decided to use stepper motors like the ones used in 3D printers and robotic vacuums. I researched 2D and 3D gantry systems and reviewed some affordable hardware components like:
a. NEMA 17 stepper motors (Amazon – $22.95 for 2-pack)
b. A4988 motor driver modules (Adafruit – $5.50 each)
c. ESP32-WROOM MCU board ($12.99 from SparkFun)
d. Water pump module (DC 6V) for fluid dispensing
e. Microfiber mop pads from Swiffer
f. Linear rail kits (250 mm, ~$30)

Then, I made a basic block diagram outlining the motion axes, controller, sensors, and pump. We considered weight, traction, and safety but not stability and cleaning head pressure. 
We will discuss those tompics sometime next week after we have a clear idea of what the chassis would look like. Although I will note that my teammates aren't committed to this topic,
so we might change our project depending on the pitches that we see next week
