Objective: Finalize full system testing, resolve final hardware issues, and make progress on documentation and demo deliverables.

Work Log:
This week was focused on debugging minor remaining issues and performing final validation of the entire PTM dome system. During our initial full-system test, 
we discovered that the opto-isolators used for the camera shutter signal had been soldered in reverse. Sam diagnosed the issue and re-soldered the components 
in the correct orientation, restoring full camera shutter functionality. Once corrected, the shutter was consistently triggered in sync with each LED during 
sequencing. With the LED system, enclosure, GUI, and camera all operational, we proceeded with a full 32-image capture cycle. During testing, we identified a 
small crack in the lens housing was disrupting image clarity and alignment. When the lens was physically held in position during operation, the dome performed 
correctly, producing 32 usable images. But, otherwise the camera did not take pictures. We notified Spurlock and began coordinating with their staff to obtain 
a new lens before the demo. Aside from the lens issue, the system performed reliably throughout the entire test session. All LED units remained stable with no 
flickering or crosstalk, and the software-hardware interactionâ€”including trigger timing was verified. On my end, I began preparing documentation for long-term
use, including a short instructional video demonstrating how to safely remove and replace a single LED unit in the dome. The video walks through disconnecting 
the JST connectors, removing the 3D printed retainer, and installing a new bulb unit. I also started working on teh Requirements & Verification Table which is 
required for the final demo.
