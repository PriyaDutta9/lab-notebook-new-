Objective: Begin testing with the first assembled PCB and validate functionality of power and LED driver subsystems
 
Work Log: 
This week, we received the first print of our PCB from pcbway. Sam completed the surface mount soldering for all core components, including the ATmega32U4 
microcontroller, switching power supply, opto-isolator, and four LED drivers. Once the board was fully assembled, we began benchtop testing using our regulated 
12V barrel-jack power supply. Initial testing revealed two critical issues. First, the barrel jack connector on our PSU was slightly undersized compared to 
the footprint on our PCB. As a temporary workaround, we soldered jumper wires to the inner and outer barrel jack pads to deliver power reliably. This will 
be resolved with a proper-sized replacement before we send the dome to Spurlock Museum. Second, we moved on to testing LED output. Unfortunately, we discovered 
that the MR11 landscape LEDs, originally included in the dome build, did not behave correctly when driven by the TLE8108EM ICs. The bulbs exhibited erratic 
flashing, likely due to interference between the bulb’s internal overcurrent circuitry and the driver's built-in protection features. To isolate the issue, we 
disassembled a MR11 LED and connected the raw LED wafer directly to the driver output using alligator clips. The LEDs lit up normally, confirming that the LED 
drivers and control logic were operating correctly and that the bulb internals were causing the problem. So, we decided to order standalone wafer-style LEDs 
with simple internal circuitry from amazon and build a custom LED unit.
