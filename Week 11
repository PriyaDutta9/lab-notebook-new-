Objective: 
Finalize the control enclosure and supporting mount structure, and fabricate custom LED units for full dome integration.

Work Log:
This week, I finalized and printed the complete control enclosure design, which now includes a base, a vented lid, and a side-mounted support structure. The 
enclosure features labeled cutouts for all ports: USB-C, camera shutter, power, and all four LED connector groups. Each label is engraved on the outer surface 
of the enclosure to ensure easy access and user-friendliness. The lid and base are fastened with standard M3 machine screws through brass heat-set inserts 
for long-term durability.Figure 1 below shows the finalized enclosure base with cutouts and heat-set insert mounting holes. Figure 2 shows the lid design with 
ventilation slots and engraved labeling. The supporting structure—shown in Figure 3 was also completed. It lifts the enclosure off the wooden dome base by 4 inches
using a side-mounted bracket approach. This helps with cable routing and prevents strain or accidental disconnection. The base is secured via wood screws 
through L-brackets in the support frame.

Meanwhile, Sam and I also completed the fabrication of the custom LED units. Since the original MR11 bulbs conflicted with our driver ICs due to built-in 
overcurrent protection, we switched to a simplified “dumb” LED wafers. We depinned the LED wafers using a soldering iron to remove the metal base pins. We then 
soldered 2-pin male JST connectors directly to the LED wafer leads. Figure 4 shows the resulting LED unit. To complete the integration, we 3D-printed small circular 
bulb retainers that snugly fit into the existing sockets on the dome, shown in Figure 5. These retainers are designed to hold the LED wafer in place and allow it 
to sit flush against the dome surface without adhesive. Once inserted, the male connector clips directly into the female connector already wired into the dome.
By the end of the week, the entire LED replacement process have been documented and successfully integrated into the dome. The board enclosure and support structure 
are also already fit-tested to ensure alignment and stability. T
