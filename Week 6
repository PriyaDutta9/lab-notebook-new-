Objective:
Analyze final PCB design files to identify potential electrical issues before fabrication. Contribute to for design document submission. Begin research on mounting hardware for 3D printed control enclosure.

Work Log: 
This week we conducted a detailed review of the finalized PCB files shared by Zhongmin. Although the physical board has not yet arrived, our group met to evaluate 
the schematic and layout for potential design flaws. During our review of the camera trigger subsystem, we identified a floating pin on the opto-isolators. Without 
a pull-down resistor to ground, this output would be electrically undefined and likely cause misfires or false triggers. We annotated the schematic and flagged the 
issue for a future board reprint. Most of my time this week was spent contributing to the Design Document, which was a major course deliverable. Separately, I began
researching mechanical fasteners for the 3d printed PCB enclosure. I compiled a shortlist of standard M3 brass inserts, 6mm screws, and plastic standoffs that could 
be used to mount the board within a 3D-printed enclosure while causing as little damage to the board and/or enclosure as possible. Although I haven't yet started 
CAD modeling, this research gave me a clearer idea of what constraints and hole patterns (threaded/not threaded, cylinder depths, etc). to consider when I do begin 
that work.
