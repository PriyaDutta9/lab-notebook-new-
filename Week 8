Objective:
Complete the rewiring of the legacy LED dome with Molex connectors, finalize and test a temporary LED demo circuit for the breadboard demo, prototype a support 
structure for the PCB enclosure to improve clearance and cable routing. 

Work Log: 
This week we had the breadboard demo, but our PCB was still in fabrication. To make sure we had something functional to show, Nick and I built a demo circuit that 
used an Arduino ProMicro hich has the same ATMega32U4 chip as our PCBâ€”and a 4-to-1 MUX to drive 8 LEDs in sequence from a single GPIO set. This setup allowed us 
to validate the LED sequencing logic and camera trigger code before the full 32-LED system went live. During testing, we discovered a few bugs in the Arduino code, 
especially with edge detection timing, and were able to fix them after probing the output lines using an oscilloscope and multimeter to confirm switching delays 
and LED states. This helped ensure the logic would scale to our dome hardware later. 

Also this week, we completed the full LED rewiring of the dome using  Molex connectors, which grouped the 32 wires into four labeled and heat-shrunk cable bundles. 
After assembly, we tested continuity across all four connectors and verified proper routing using a digital multimeter. On the mechanical side, I worked on designing
a support structure to raise the control enclosure vertically by about 4 inches above the wooden base. This was needed because the initial enclosure left very little
room for cable clearance and made it hard to access connectors. The frame I built had four vertical legs with countersunk mounting holes to be screwed into the base. 
However, once mounted, I noticed that although the height was good, the orientation was awkward because the enclosure still faced outward, and the wire entry looked 
untidy. So, I will have to do something about it this next week.
