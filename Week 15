Objective: Complete all final deliverables and conclude the project.

Work Log:
This was our final week of ECE 445. We completed our final demo successfully and showed full LED sequencing and synchronized image capture in both automatic and 
manual mode. The final presentation took place on Tuesday, May 6, and went smoothly. We submitted the final report on May 7 where we covered all technical sections, 
testing results, and long-term documentation. This lab notebook, due tonight, marks the final required deliverable for the course.

As a team, we were honored to receive an Honorable Mention at the final award ceremony, which was a great way to end the semester. The project is fully functional, 
and weâ€™re proud to leave a maintainable, useful system with the Spurlock Museum.
