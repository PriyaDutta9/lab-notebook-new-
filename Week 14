Objective: 
Restore board functionality and complete demo deliverables.

Work Log:
We identified a partial short on the 5V rail using a thermal camera, which showed highheat around LED Driver 2. Sam replaced the ATMega32U4 and all four LED drivers. 
After reassembly, the board passed all tests and is fully functional for demo.
I completed the Requirements & Verification table, block diagrams, and high-level requirements documents for the demo. The control enclosure was reprinted and 
successfully mounted to the dome ising wood screws and L-brackets to prevent drilling into plastic. We also completed the repair manual and began drafting the 
user manual. We are now ready for the final demo.
