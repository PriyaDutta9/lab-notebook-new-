Objective: 
Test replacement lens from Spurlock Museum and resolve any issues with power delivery or imaging.

Work Log:
This week, we focused on sourcing and testing a replacement lens to replace the cracked 50mm unit discovered last week. After coordinating with the staff at 
Spurlock Museum, we received a new 100mm lens for the Canon EOS camera.On Friday, we conducted a full system test using the new lens and the updated power jack 
connection on our PCB. But, the system unexpectedly failed during this session. None of the components responded as expected, and the dome became nonfunctional.
We began preliminary debugging steps but were unable to isolate the root cause on Friday. At present, we suspect that the issue may be linked to a power regulation 
failure or a component on the PCB that was somehow damaged. We plan to perform detailed debugging in the next week to identify the point of failure. We're glad that
the dome crashed AFTER the mock demo though.
