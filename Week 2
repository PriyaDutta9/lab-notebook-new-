We officially dropped the window cleaner and decided to pursue the PTM dome restoration project pitched by the Spurlock Museum. I emailed the previous team to ask if they would 
help us understand the issues with their PCB and Sam emailed Spurlock to gather more technical background and confirm they’d be available for ongoing collaboration. We also 
began drafting a new web post for the dome system and started aligning on goals. I worked on defining subsystems and assigning rough responsibilities across the team. 
We also completed the RFA assignment this week and I mapped out how the dome, control board, camera, and interface would interact (using USB-C, UART, SPI, and a 3.5mm audio jack). 
At this point, we are still waiting for formal approval from course staff and Professor Fliflet to "officially" start working on PTM Dome. 
Date: January 29, 2025
Objective:
Pivot to new project. Begin background research and establish communication with Spurlock Museum. Define updated project and begin component planning.

Work Log:
After a group discussion and in response to several newer project suggestions from course staff, we abandoned the window-cleaning system in favor of a new 
project: restoring the Spurlock Museum’s PTM Dome. This dome and was worked on over several years by past ECE 445 teams, but remains incomplete due to hardware/software 
limitations. I emailed the previous team to ask if they would help us understand the issues with their PCB and Sam emailed Spurlock to gather more technical background 
and confirm they’d be available for ongoing collaboration. Simultaneously, we also drafted a new web board post. This new system would involve synchronizing 32 LED light 
sources arranged in a dome with a DSLR camera shutter, capturing surface data of artifacts under varying lighting angles. I began researching how Polynomial Texture
Mapping technology works, and reviewing design docs and codebases from prior semesters shared via Box. The KiCAD assignment was also due this week
