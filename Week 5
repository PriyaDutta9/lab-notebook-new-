Objective: 
Begin planning for backup control enclosure. Assist Nick with implementing AUtomatic mode in GUI.

Work Log:
I began work on a backup plan for the control enclosure in case our 3D-printed design didn’t work out. I talked to the ECEB machine shop and they said the had a 
discarded steel project box with vent slots and a hinged acrylic lid. I proposed modifying it by drilling out slots for the USB-C port, power jack, and Molex 
connectors. To mount the PCB inside, I planned to attach four plastic PCB standoffs (recovered from a demo board from a previous class) directly to the enclosure 
base using small self-tapping screws. I also marked the positions for mounting holes using masking tape and measured alignment using calipers. This would let us 
screw the PCB in from below without needing any precise fabrication. I also helped Nick modify the existing Python and Arduino code to make it compatible with 
our microcontroller and LED drivers.
