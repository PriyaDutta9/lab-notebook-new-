Objective:
Design and print the first prototype of the control enclosure base for the PTM dome system. Verify mounting hole alignment, PCB fit, and connector placement. Evaluate thermal design and ergonomics.

Work Log:
This week, I focused on modeling and fabricating the first functional prototype of the enclosure base for our PCB. The goal was to provide a robust housing that 
would physically protect the board, allow proper airflow, and simplify wiring and maintenance for museum staff. Using Fusion 360, I designed a rectangular base 
with internal standoff poles to match the PCB’s 4 mounting holes. I spaced the cylindrical standoffs according to our board layout (approx. 95mm × 55mm between 
centers), each 12 mm tall, and designed them to be used with M3 heat-set brass inserts. The standoffs were printed directly as part of the base, and they 
successfully aligned with the board on the first try so I didn't need any revisions for that. I added three ventilation slots each to the lid and base to allow
passive heat dissipation which is especially important when the system is used in long capture sessions.

I also included connector cutouts ports on the sidewall, and circular ports for the power barrel jack and 3.5mm shutter trigger jack on the other side. Each cutout 
was labeled in the model using text embossing for clarity (e.g., “Connector 1,” “Power,” etc.). The fit of the connector openings was too loose, especially for 
the Molex connectors, which shifted during insertion. The slots were around 12.5mm wide, and based on this result, I plan to shorten them down to around 11.8mm in 
the next version to ensure a snug press-fit. After printing the prototype in PLA at 0.2mm layer height with 40% infill, I tested the fit of the PCB in the base. 
The board sat cleanly on the standoffs and the screw holes aligned well, but we encountered an issue with the enclosure’s orientation when placed on the wooden base 
of the dome. Without any additional structure beneath it, the box sat flush against the base and protruded awkwardly, both visually and mechanically. There was no 
clearance for the wire bundles, and the Molex connectors had to bend sharply as they exited the sidewall. This bending risked long-term wear on the connector housing 
and wires, and it also looked ugly. So, I think the enclosure needs vertical elevation of about 4 inches off the wooden platform to improve cable routing and ergonomics.
 
I shared the prototype with Sam and Nick and documented all necessary design fixes for the user manual. Moving forward, I’ll need to revise the connector cutouts, 
make a support structure to add height, and eventually redesign the lid to fix a tiny screw alignment issue.
